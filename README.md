**How did the idea for the company come about?**

I previously worked at Qualcomm.  During Mobile World Congress (MWC) I caught up with a previous boss and mentor of mine who was showcasing advances in AI at Qualcomm.  Since the meeting I have wanted to dig deeper into their efforts and this case study provided that opportunity.

**How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**

Qualcomm was originally funded by the sale of a two-way mobile satellite communications system known as Omnitracs that supported tractor trailer logistics.  Today, Qualcomm is mainly funded by revenue generated the development, licensing and supply of integrated circuits and system software based on mobile technologies such as 3G, 4G, and 5G.

## Business Activities

**What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?**

Qualcomm's overall Generative AI strategy is to push the required compute to the edge for a wide range of connected devices including smartphones, PCs, vehicles and Internet of Things (IOT) products.  By doing so, Qualcomm hopes to improve performance, privacy, and reliability when compared to cloud-based solutions.[^2]

**Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**

Qualcomm's intended customers are Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) and the development community that supports the OEMs many ecosystems.  McKinsey & company estimates the potential Generative AI market at $7.9 trillion.[^3]

**What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?** 

Qualcomm's AI technology integrates the AI capabilities of the Central Processing Unit (CPU), Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), and the Neural Processing Unit (NPU) on its chipsets enabling efficient on-device processing.  Their on-device AI processing can provide lower cost, improved privacy reduced latency and increased reliability compared to cloud-based solutions.

**Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them**?

A number of Qualcomm research papers[^4] mention the usage of Bayesian Deep Learning. Bayesian deep learning provides a principled framework for model comparison, which involves comparing the posterior probabilities of different models given the observed data.[^5] Qualcomm is utilizing Bayesian Deep Learning to optimize their on-device machine learning to ensure efficiency.

## Landscape

**What field is the company in?**

Qualcomm is in the semiconductor and technology industry.

**What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?**

There have been a number of innovations in on-device AI over the last 10 years including Computer Vision, Wireless and RF Sensing, Speech, Audio and Language processing, and data compression and generative modeling.  However, Qualcomm has always been concerned with Power efficiency as a differentiator.  In this regard, Qualcomm has made strides in model design, quantization, neural architecture search (NAS), complier algorithms and more efficient hardware.[^6]

**What are the other major companies in this field?**

Due to Qualcomm's reach, they compete with a number of other AI companies.  However, their major AI hardware companies include NVIDIA, Alphabet, Intel, and IBM.[^7]

## Results

**What has been the business impact of this company so far?**

Qualcomm's AI strategy has allowed them to enter new chipset markets such as automotive, PCs and AR/VR.  However, the introduction of developer tools to build on their architecture has allowed them to establish themselves as a leader in the space while providing developers a low barrier of entry to get started utilizing AI for solutions in healthcare, advertising and others.  A great example is their partnership with [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/qualcomm) that provides the tools and community to quickly get up and running with AI.

**What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?**

Qualcomm will likely use a combination of market share, product integration, and new application development as key metrics to evaluate the success of its AI strategy.  From a technical perspective, metrics like inference-per-second, inference-per-second-per-watt, and the ability to support large AI models will be used.[^8]

**How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?**

NVIDA is currently the leader in the space with chipsets that are more performant and energy efficient than Qualcomm's.  Qualcomm looks to differentiate itself in the space by positioning itself as the on-device and hybrid AI leader providing more cost-effective and scalable solutions than its more cloud-centric competitors.

## Recommendations

**If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?**

Based on their current AI strategy of utilzing compute at the edge I would suggest leaning into both models that utilize bias and Small Language Models.[^9]

[^9]:[The Rise of Small Language Models](https://thenewstack.io/the-rise-of-small-language-models/). The New Stack. Kimberley Mok. February 16, 2024.

**Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?**

Increased bias and small language models will allow Qualcomm to create regional, community and even household-based models.  These models lend themselves to AI at the edge and a strategy that builds itself around increased privacy.

**What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?**

Decentralized storage and user-initiated, mesh-based models would enhance their hybrid AI model, provide additional revenue streams, and provide significant end-user benefits including cost, security and privacy.

**Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?**

The technologies are appropriate for my solution because they align with Qualcomm's core business strategy.
